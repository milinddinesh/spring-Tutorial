# spring-Tutorial
A repo for storing my String application that I use to learn the framework. I'll keep adding featuers to this as I leaern more and more concepts.

*This project uses gradle* 

# Requirements
Java 17 

# Set Up 
If you want to run the application on your device , simply clone the repo to a folder and run the command `./gradlew Bootun`.

You can also build the application to a jar file with the command `./gradlew build` and run the jar file with the command
`java -jar build/libs/db_demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar `
